Supplemental consists of webscraper notebooks that we used in collecting data and it includes some preliminary data cleaning but majority was done using Excel and Notepad.
Some of Milestone ipynb files may require usage of xlsx or csv files found in the same folder. Make sure to use T4 GPU runtime in Google Colab when running these files. 
For IGBO POS and NER approaches ipynb, you will need to change Runtime to Runtime Type to T4 GPU, and use ner dataset.xlsx file (see in Corpus folder)
For Mileston_6 make sure to use declaration_top_10.txt file and switch runtime to T4 GPU.
